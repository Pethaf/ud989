MVO = design pattern

M = model (underlying data)
V = view (what the user sees)
O = octopus (links model and view)

O = {Controller/Presentation Controller/*/Whatever};

Model only ever talks to octopus, View only ever talks to octopus


Refactoring = changing code without changing functionality.
E.g. breaking large/complex functions into smaller parts.
Without breaking external interface.

Sometimes code that can't be refactored has to be reimplemented
(while maintaining external interface).
